	 <h2 class="Carroth">Carrot Escape</h2>
	 <p class="pcarrot">This is Carrot Escape, I made this game in school in the 8th grade, with my partner Youssef Zayed, with some other help on the art from my good friend Soheil AlAhmar. This game is about a carrot that was being tested on, by a crazy scientist, the carrot came to life and tried to escape, while you play this game, you are running and jumping above obstacles, then the scientist made a burger, french fries, and a marshmallow chase you. They were ordered to bring you back dead or alive. Thus the fight begins between the carrot and the junk food. For the rest of the game, you try to escape and kill the scientist's creations.</p>

	 <h2 class="Monsterh">Monster Island</h2>
	 <p class="pcarrot">This is Monster Island, I made this game entirely by myself in the 9th grade, this game is a bit more complicated, this is a survival game, you try to survive on an island full of monsters and haunted houses. You are being chased by these monsters, you are given 1 weapon in the beginning of the game, you can go look for more, which are usually in haunted houses. How long can you survive in that kind of world? If you would like to see the game<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwHgGkqi3MQ"> click Here </a> </p>
